This script binds keys on a Nintendo Switch Left Joy-Con controller to keys and keystrokes that are useful while using Clip Studio Paint on a Mac.

You are welcome to clone and edit it to use for whatever you like (MIT License).

Bindings:

- Dpad Left/Right: Scroll through Pen, Pencil, Brush, and Eraser
- Dpad Up: Hold for rotate tool
- Dpad Down: Hold for hand tool
- L: Eyedropper
- ZL: Undo
- SL: Redo
- SR: Save
- Analog Up: Increase Zoom
- Analog Down: Decrease Zoom
- Analog Stick Press: Reset Zoom and Press F12 (I recommend you bind F12 to "reset rotate/invert")
